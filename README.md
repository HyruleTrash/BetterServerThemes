# BetterServerThemes
BetterServerThemes is a BetterDiscord plugin based on a other plugin called ServerThemes.

I wanted to use the plugin found here, but it seemed to be broken
https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ServerThemes

And so I decided to create my own, feel free to use it however you want, just don't sell it, or promote it as your own.
During the creation of this plugin i used these helping hands:
- https://docs.betterdiscord.app/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPovi-jgw9E
- phind.com

The plugin works as follows:
Set which themes you want to have active when using the settings window.
See it change depending on in which server you are in, or even if you're not even in a server

# !! warning !!
installing this plugin makes it take control over enabling and disabling your themes!
